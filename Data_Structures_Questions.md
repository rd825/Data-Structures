Answer the following questions for each of the data structures you implemented as part of this project.

## Queue

1. What is the runtime complexity of `enqueue`?<br/>
   O(1), because the list method append has constant runtime complexity.<br/><br/>

2. What is the runtime complexity of `dequeue`?<br/>
   O(1), because the list method pop has constant runtime complexity.<br/><br/>

3. What is the runtime complexity of `len`?<br/>
   O(1), because the list method len has constant runtime complexity.<br/><br/>
